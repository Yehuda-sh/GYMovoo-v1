# Equipment-Aware Workout Plans - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview

This PR implements intelligent equipment-aware workout plan generation that:

- ✅ Filters exercises based on user's available equipment
- ✅ Provides intelligent equipment substitutions
- ✅ Falls back to bodyweight exercises when needed
- ✅ Integrates seamlessly with existing Supabase data flow

## 📁 Files Modified/Created

### Core Implementation

- **`src/utils/equipmentCatalog.ts`** - NEW: Equipment taxonomy and substitution logic
- **`src/stores/userStore.ts`** - UPDATED: Equipment data access selectors
- **`src/screens/workout/services/workoutLogicService.ts`** - UPDATED: Equipment-aware exercise filtering

### Testing

- **`src/tests/equipmentCatalog.test.ts`** - NEW: Comprehensive test suite

## 🔧 Key Features

### 1. Equipment Normalization

```typescript
// Handles synonyms and variations
normalizeEquipment(["dumbbells", "free weights"]);
// → ['dumbbell']
```

### 2. Intelligent Substitutions

```typescript
// Machine exercises can substitute with dumbbells
canPerform(["machine"], ["dumbbell"]); // → true

// Hierarchical fallbacks: machine → dumbbell → bodyweight
```

### 3. Exercise Availability Scoring

```typescript
// Perfect match = 1.0, substitutions = 0.8-0.6, bodyweight = 0.3
getExerciseAvailability(["machine"], ["dumbbell"]);
// → { canPerform: true, score: 0.8, substitution: 'dumbbell' }
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Equipment Catalog System

- **23+ Equipment Types**: Complete taxonomy from machines to bodyweight
- **Synonym Mapping**: Handles variations like "dumbbells" → "dumbbell"
- **Substitution Hierarchy**: Smart fallbacks with scoring
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with EquipmentTag union

### Integration Points

- **User Store**: Accesses equipment from `customDemoUser.equipment` or `trainingstats.selectedEquipment`
- **Workout Service**: Enhanced exercise filtering with equipment intelligence
- **Existing UI**: No changes needed - works with current questionnaire flow

## 🧪 Testing

Comprehensive test coverage includes:

- ✅ Equipment normalization and synonym handling
- ✅ Substitution logic validation
- ✅ Edge cases (no equipment, invalid equipment)
- ✅ Integration workflow testing

## 🚀 Usage Example

```typescript
// User has dumbbells and resistance bands
const userEquipment = useUserEquipment(); // ['dumbbell', 'resistance_bands']

// Generate workout for chest day
const exercises = selectExercisesForDay(
  "חזה",
  userEquipment,
  "intermediate",
  45,
  { goal: "muscle_gain" }
);

// Result: Mix of dumbbell exercises + machine exercises substituted with dumbbells
```

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. **User completes questionnaire** → Equipment stored in Supabase
2. **Workout generation** → `useUserEquipment()` retrieves normalized equipment
3. **Exercise filtering** → `canPerform()` checks equipment compatibility
4. **Smart substitution** → `getExerciseAvailability()` scores alternatives
5. **Workout delivery** → Optimized exercise list with user's equipment

## 🎛️ Configuration

Equipment substitution rules are easily configurable in `equipmentCatalog.ts`:

```typescript
export const SUBSTITUTIONS: Record<EquipmentTag, EquipmentTag[]> = {
  machine: ["dumbbell", "barbell", "cable", "resistance_bands", "bodyweight"],
  cable: ["resistance_bands", "dumbbell", "bodyweight"],
  // ... fully customizable
};
```

## 🔜 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Equipment preference learning (user feedback on substitutions)
- [ ] Equipment purchase recommendations
- [ ] Gym vs. home workout modes
- [ ] Equipment-specific exercise variations

## 🧩 Backward Compatibility

- ✅ Existing workout generation continues to work
- ✅ No breaking changes to current UI/UX
- ✅ Graceful degradation when equipment data unavailable
- ✅ Maintains all existing Supabase integrations

**Ready for Review & Testing** 🚀

This implementation provides a solid foundation for equipment-aware workout personalization while maintaining full compatibility with the existing GYMovoo system.
