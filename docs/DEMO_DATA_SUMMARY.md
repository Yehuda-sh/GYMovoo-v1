**Solution:**
✅ Created complete questionnaire data for all users with distinct profiles:

**Verification:** `scripts/checkAllDemoUsers.js` confirms all users now have 100% complete questionnaires with 13/13 questions answered.

**Data Source Clarification:** All questionnaire data is based on the original `smartquestionnairedata` that existed before demo script modifications. Extraneous fields like activity level, sleep hours, stress level, and detailed motivation factors that were not in the original data have been removed to maintain authenticity.

2. **Algorithm Testing:** Test new workout algorithms with realistic data
3. **Performance Testing:** Ensure app handles the demo data efficiently
4. **Analytics Testing:** Verify reporting and insights generation

## 📋 Important Guidelines

**For Future Demo Data Work:** See `docs/DEMO_DATA_GUIDELINES.md` for critical rules about data integrity and source authenticity. Never add fields or values not present in original data sources.
