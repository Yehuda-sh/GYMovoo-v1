# Implementation Strategy and Next Steps

This document outlines our implementation strategy for the GYMovoo app refactoring project, based on our analysis of the current architecture and components.

## Phase 1: Foundational Structure (In Progress)

### 1.1 âœ… Create Core Types

- âœ… Create centralized type definitions in `src/core/types`
- âœ… Implement user.types.ts, questionnaire.types.ts, workout.types.ts, etc.
- âœ… Set up proper type exports via index.ts

### 1.2 ðŸ”„ Establish Feature Folder Structure

- âœ… Set up the main directory structure according to our architecture plan
- âœ… Create placeholder README files in each feature directory
- âœ… Document each feature's purpose and responsibilities

### 1.3 Refactor Navigation Structure

- Move navigation files to core/navigation
- Update imports in existing files
- Ensure navigation types are properly defined
- Structure for feature-based navigation extensions

## Phase 2: Core Features Migration

### 2.1 Auth Feature

- Move and refactor auth-related screens
- Extract LoginForm and RegisterForm components
- DEPRECATED: useAuth hook removed - now using central userStore instead
- Implement comprehensive tests

### 2.2 Questionnaire Feature

- Move questionnaire screen and related components
- Extract smaller components from UnifiedQuestionnaireScreen
- Move questionnaire service to the feature module
- Implement flexible questionnaire configuration

### 2.3 Home Feature (MainScreen)

- Break down MainScreen into smaller components
- Create custom hooks for data fetching
- Implement proper loading states and error handling
- Optimize animations and performance

## Phase 3: Supporting Features Migration

### 3.1 Profile Feature

- Move ProfileScreen and related components
- Extract settings, achievements, and avatar components
- Create dedicated hooks for profile data
- Implement comprehensive tests

### 3.2 Workouts Feature

- Move workout-related screens and components
- Refactor workout services
- Implement clean separation of concerns
- Create reusable workout components

### 3.3 Exercises Feature

- Move exercise-related screens and components
- Organize exercise data and services
- Implement efficient exercise filtering
- Create comprehensive exercise type definitions

### 3.4 History & Progress Features

- Move history and progress screens
- Create reusable chart and stats components
- Implement efficient data storage and retrieval
- Add comprehensive analytics capabilities

## Phase 4: State Management Refactoring

### 4.1 User Store Refactoring

- Split userStore into domain-specific stores
- Create authStore for authentication
- Move questionnaire state to questionnaireStore
- Ensure backward compatibility

### 4.2 User Preferences Refactoring

- Break down useUserPreferences into smaller hooks
- Create dedicated preferences service
- Implement proper caching and memoization
- Ensure type safety and error handling

### 4.3 Service Layer Improvements

- Standardize service interfaces
- Implement proper error handling
- Add caching and optimization
- Create service factories where appropriate

## Phase 5: Final Integration and Testing

### 5.1 Comprehensive Testing

- Write unit tests for all new components and hooks
- Implement integration tests for key user flows
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing code
- Validate performance improvements

### 5.2 Documentation

- Update documentation for all features
- Create usage examples for reusable components
- Document architecture decisions
- Provide migration guide for future development

### 5.3 Performance Optimization

- Implement React.memo where appropriate
- Optimize renders and re-renders
- Add proper loading states and skeleton screens
- Measure and improve bundle size

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Complete core type definitions for all domains
2. Begin implementing the auth feature migration
3. Create a sample implementation of a smaller feature to validate approach
4. Refactor navigation structure to support feature-based organization
5. Break down MainScreen into smaller components for better maintainability

## Long-term Goals

1. Achieve full type safety across the application
2. Reduce bundle size and improve performance
3. Simplify the state management strategy
4. Improve the developer experience with better tooling and documentation
5. Implement a comprehensive testing strategy
